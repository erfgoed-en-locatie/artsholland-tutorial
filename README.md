sparql tutorial for artsholland-platform


This visual tutorial explains the Arts Holland data and data model, and the SPARQL code you can use to query the data. Example queries will let you traverse into the Arts Holland RDF database, and you are able to view and modify each query on the Arts Holland SPARQL endpoint itself. All the SPARQL constructions and keywords that are used in this tutorial are explained, but if you need more in-depth explanation, you could have a look at both the SPARQL Tutorial Wikibook and SPARQL by Example from Cambridge Semantics.

The Arts Holland data platform, developer's site and SPARQL tutorial are created and hosted by Waag Society.
